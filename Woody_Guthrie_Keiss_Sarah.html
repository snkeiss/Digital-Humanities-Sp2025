<h2>Background</h2>
<p> Woody Guthrie was an American folk singer born in Okemah, Oklahoma in 
1912. After marrying and having three children, the Great Depression 
impacted his ability to support his family. He decided to hitchhike his 
way to California to search for better opportunities.</p>
<h2>Music Career</h2>
<p>After moving to California, he got a job at a radio show where he began 
to start writing and performing songs. His music grew in popularity after 
moving to New York in 1940. As anti-communist sentiments grew in the late 
1940s and early 1950s, Woody and other folk singers were targeted for 
their 
stances on unions and free speech. In 1954, he was diagnosed with 
Huntington's Disease, following which, he ended his music career. Woody 
Guthrie died in 1967, but he is still known today as one of the most 
important folk singers of all time, and as someone who spoke up for the 
disenfranchised.</p>
